I accessed the Spotify API through the SpotiPy library on Python and extracted data about my personal usage in the last 4 weeks. I analyzed my listening activity and extracted audio features from my most listened to tracks to create a playlist of recommendations based on these tracks. I used Cosine Similarity to further filter out songs. Originally, the playlist was 100 songs but I filtered out 67 and 33 remained. I actually really likeds the final playlist. Some songs in it became some of my favorites this month.

Here is a link to the playlist for anyone who is interested: [Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2hD4Jy2wz1grBeD3g8GayZ?si=86ec59c20f2d425d)
